PrestaShop-MadModules
=====================

Uses overrides!
Requiers a manual edit of PS/YOUR_THEME/identity.tpl
Add {HOOK_CUSTOMER_IDENTITY} in a place at your choosing.
I recommend after current_password field
If placed directly after e-mail field, Firefox will ask customer if they wan't to save password for the site, using the cc_email
